**Last Updated:** 2024  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Purpose:**  
High-converting soft-launch landing page for Ekantik Capital Advisors' "Wealth Package for Small Businesses" Founding Member program. Designed to attract qualified business owners and generate applications for a limited cohort (25 members or $100M AUM).

**Target Audience:**  
US-based small business owners (S-corp/LLC/partnership) with $1M+ revenue, profitable operations, and challenges with:
- High taxation
- Weak reserves and protection
- Key employee retention
- Poor retirement architecture
- Exit readiness / valuation concerns
- Cash flow optimization

---

## 🚀 What This Landing Page Does

This is a **Smart Brevity-style**, conversion-optimized landing page featuring:

### Core Value Proposition
Turn taxes into fuel for growth, protection, and a stronger exit—through a flat-fee, fiduciary-minded advisory program that coordinates:
- Tax reduction strategies (Defined Benefit Plans, 831(b), coordination)
- Business protection & reserves (Emergency fund, SERP retention plans)
- Cash flow compounding engine (risk-managed, no guarantees)
- Exit readiness improvements (process optimization, valuation drivers)

### Founding Member Exclusivity
- **Performance Commitment:** Implementation speed + measurable KPIs
- **Locked Terms:** No new Ekantik fees in later years + flat-fee structure locked
- **Priority Queue:** Founder-level involvement + early access to tools
